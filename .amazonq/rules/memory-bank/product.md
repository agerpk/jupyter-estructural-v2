# Product Overview

## Project Purpose
AGP (Análisis General de Postaciones) is a specialized engineering application for designing and analyzing electrical transmission line structures. The system performs comprehensive structural calculations for high-voltage power line towers, including mechanical analysis, cable tensioning, wind loads, and pole selection.

## Value Proposition
- Automates complex structural engineering calculations for electrical transmission lines
- Provides visual analysis through interactive dashboards and 3D structure visualization
- Ensures compliance with AEA (Asociación Electrotécnica Argentina) standards
- Reduces design time through automated pole selection and load tree generation
- Supports multiple structure types: suspension, retention, angular, and terminal configurations

## Key Features

### Structural Design
- Geometric design of tower heads with configurable dispositions (triangular, horizontal, vertical)
- Support for single and double circuit configurations (220kV)
- Automatic pole selection from concrete pole library
- Multi-pole structure support (mono, bi, tri-pole configurations)

### Mechanical Analysis
- Cable mechanical calculations (CMC) with temperature and tension states
- Wind load calculations with ice accumulation scenarios
- Load hypothesis generation following AEA standards
- Structural reaction analysis under multiple load conditions
- 3D visualization of structures and load distributions

### Cable Management
- Comprehensive cable library (conductor and guard wires)
- Cable sag and tension calculations across climatic states
- Support for OPGW (Optical Ground Wire) configurations
- Automatic cable parameter optimization

### Interactive Dashboard
- Web-based interface using Dash/Plotly
- Real-time parameter adjustment and recalculation
- Visual load tree generation for each hypothesis
- Export capabilities for calculation reports and diagrams
